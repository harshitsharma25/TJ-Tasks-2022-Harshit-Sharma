            <p style="font-size:20px ;margin:80px ;justify-content: center;display: flex;flex-direction: column;">Amer
                Fort (often also spelt "Amber") was built as a fortified palace in 1592 by Maharaja Man Singh I and has
                long served as the capital of Jaipur. Carved high up into the hillside, the fort is accessible on foot
                via a steep climb or by shuttle rides from the town below (better still, let an elephant do the work).
                <br>
                Just above Amer Fort is Jaigarh Fort, built in 1726 by Jai Singh and featuring tall lookout towers,
                formidable walls, and the world's largest wheeled cannon. Be sure to also spend time wandering the
                walled Old City of Jaipur with its three fully restored gates and splendid bazaars, as well as the
                delightful City Palace, a massive complex of courtyards, gardens, and buildings.

            <p style="font-size:20px ;margin:80px ;justify-content: center;display: flex;flex-direction: column;">
                Perhaps India's most recognizable building, the Taj Mahal is also the world's most famous testimony to
                the power of love. Named after Mumtaz Mahal, the favorite wife of Emperor Shah Jahan, this most
                beautiful of mausoleums was begun upon her death in 1631 and took 20,000 workmen until 1648 to complete.
                <br>

                Incorporating many elements of Islamic design including arches, minarets, an onion-shaped dome, and
                black calligraphy inlaid around the entrance, the Taj Mahal is largely constructed of white marble.
                Adding to its splendor are delicate inlaid floral patterns and precious and semi-precious stones such as
                jade, lapis lazuli, diamonds, and mother of pearl.

                    <p>3. Mumbai: The Gateway of India</p>

            </li>
            <p style="font-size:20px ;margin:80px ;justify-content: center;display: flex;flex-direction: column;">
                Standing an impressive 26 meters tall and overlooking the Arabian Sea, the iconic Gateway of India is a
                must-see when in Mumbai. Built to commemorate the arrival of King George V and his wife Queen Mary in
                1911, this stunning piece of architecture was opened with much pomp and ceremony in 1924 and was, for a
                while, the tallest structure in the city. <br>

                Constructed entirely of yellow basalt and concrete and notable for its Indo-Saracenic design, the
                Gateway of India was also the scene of a rather less jubilant procession of British soldiers in 1948
                when India gained its independence. These days, the huge archway provides a stunning backdrop that is as
                popular among locals as it is tourists.</p>

                    <p id="heading">4. Harmandir Sahib: The Golden Temple of Amritsar</p>
                </div> <img src="project 3 images-2\-harmandir-sahib.jpg" alt="No Loading">
            </li>
            <p style="font-size:20px ;margin:80px ;justify-content: center;display: flex;flex-direction: column;">
                Founded in 1577 by Ram Das, Amritsar is an important hub of Sikh history and culture. The main
                attraction here is Harmandir Sahib, opened in 1604 and still often referred to as the Golden Temple for
                its beautiful gold decoration. <br>

                The holiest of India's many Sikh shrines (it also attracts many Hindus and people of other faiths), the
                temple was built in a blend of Hindu and Islamic styles. Its lower marble section features such
                flourishes as ornate inlaid floral and animal motifs, while the large golden dome represents a lotus
                flower, a symbol of purity to Sikhs. <br>

                In addition to its splendid design, visitors are equally impressed with the temple's spiritual
                atmosphere, an effect enhanced by the prayers continuously chanted from the Sikh holy book and broadcast
                throughout the complex.</p>


            <li data-aos="fade-left">
                <div>
                    <p>5. The Golden City: Jaisalmer</p>

            </li>
            <p style="font-size:20px ;margin:80px ;justify-content: center;display: flex;flex-direction: column;">So
                named for the yellow sandstone used in most of its buildings, the Golden City of Jaisalmer is an oasis
                of splendid old architecture that rises from the sand dunes of the Thar Desert. Once a strategic
                outpost, today the city is filled with splendid old mansions; magnificent gateways; and the massive
                Jaisalmer Fort, also known as the Golden Fort, a daunting 12th-century structure that rises high above
                the town. <br>

                In addition to its palaces, temples, and fine old homes, the fortress boasts 99 bastions along with
                massive gates leading to its main courtyard where you'll find the seven-story-tall Maharaja's Palace.
                Started in the early 1500s and added to by successive rulers right up until the 19th century, the palace
                offers sections open to the public, including areas beautifully decorated with tiles from Italy and
                China, and intricately carved stone doors.</p>


            <li data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="8000">
                <div>
                    <p>6. The Red Fort, New Delhi</p>
                </div> <img src="project 3 images-2\-red-fort.jpg" alt="No Loading">
            </li>
            <p style="font-size:20px ;margin:80px ;justify-content: center;display: flex;flex-direction: column;">Built
                by Shah Jahan in 1648 as the seat of Mughal power – a role it maintained until 1857 – the magnificent
                crescent-shaped Red Fort in New Delhi, named after the stunning red sandstone used in its construction,
                covers a vast area of more than two square kilometers, all of it surrounded by a large moat. <br>

                Highlights include its two largest gates: the impressive Lahore Gate (the fort's main entrance) and the
                elaborately decorated Delhi Gate, once used by the emperor for ceremonial processions. <br>

                A fun part of a visit is exploring Chatta Chowk, a 17th-century covered bazaar selling everything from
                jewelry to silk garments, as well as souvenirs and food items. While you can explore the fort yourself,
                guided tours are offered and provide a fascinating insight into the life and times of the Shah,
                including a peek into the stunning white marble Hall of Public Audiences (Diwan-i-Am) where he received
                his subjects.</p>


            <li data-aos="fade-left">

            </li>
            <p style="font-size:20px ;margin:80px ;justify-content: center;display: flex;flex-direction: column;">
                Varanasi offers many reasons to visit, not least of them the chance to explore the Old Quarter adjacent
                to the Ganges where you'll find the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, built in 1780. The New Vishwanath Temple
                with its seven separate temples is also of interest. <br>

                Bathing in the Ganges is of great importance to Hindus, and numerous locations known as "ghats" feature
                stairways leading to the water where the faithful bathe before prayers. The largest are Dasashvamedh
                Ghat and Assi Ghat. The latter, at the confluence of the Ganges and Asi rivers, is considered
                particularly holy. <br>

                Also worth seeing is Banaras Hindu University, established in 1917 and noted for its massive library
                with more than a million books, and the superb Bharat Kala Bhavan museum featuring fine collections of
                miniature paintings, sculptures, palm-leaf manuscripts, and local history exhibits.</p>

                as a military structure in 1565 by Emperor Akbar with later additions by Shah Jahan, the stunning Agra
                Fort (also known as Agra's Red Fort) is an interesting mix of both Hindu and Muslim influences. <br>

                Located a little more than two kilometers from the Taj Mahal, the fort is entered through Amar Singh
                Gate with its low outer wall and dogleg design built to confuse attackers. Once inside, you'll see two
                large interlinked sandstone buildings, Akbari Mahal and Jahangiri Mahal, the largest private residence
                in the complex.</p>

            <p style="font-size:20px ;margin:80px ;justify-content: center;display: flex;flex-direction: column;">The
                famous monumental Ellora Caves were built between the 5th and 10th centuries by Buddhist, Jain, and
                Hindu monks, and make for an excellent excursion from Mumbai, some 300 kilometers to the west. <br>

                Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, this remarkable collection of 34 carved monasteries, chapels, and
                temples – 12 of them Buddhist, 17 Hindu, and five belonging to the Jain faith – were built in close
                proximity to each other, a reflection of the religious tolerance that existed during this period of
                Indian history. <br>

                Of the Buddhist monastery caves, highlights include a number of shrines featuring carvings of Buddha and
                saints dating from the 5th to 7th centuries, as well as the stunning Carpenter's Cave, considered one of
                the finest in India.</p>

            <p style="font-size:20px ;margin:80px ;justify-content: center;display: flex;flex-direction: column;">For
                those looking for peace and quiet, isolated Agonda Beach is a good choice, while Calangute Beach is by
                far the most commercial and crowded. For those in search of posh resorts, yoga getaways, and spa
                vacations, the beaches of Mandrem, Morjim, and Ashwem are fashionable among wealthy Indians and
                Westerners alike. Palolem is another one of Goa's popular beaches in a beautiful setting. <br>

                While in Goa, be sure to visit the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary. This superb attraction is home to
                thick forests and plenty of fauna, including deer, monkeys, elephants, leopards, tigers, and black
                panthers, as well as India's famous king cobras, and some 200 species of birds. <br>

                Also worth a visit is Divar Island, accessed by ferry from Old Goa. Highlights include Piedade, a
                typical Goan village and home to the Church of Our Lady of Compassion with its interesting stucco work,
                Baroque plaster decorations, and altars, as well as stunning views of the surrounding countryside.</p>

                Bodhgaya, considered the world's holiest Buddhist site, attracts thousands of visitors each year, all
                drawn to participate with the resident monks in meditation and prayer. <br>

                The focal point of this place of pilgrimage is stunning Mahabodhi Temple, built next to the very spot
                where Buddha came to Enlightenment and formulated his philosophy on life. Constructed in the 6th century
                and restored numerous times since, the temple is topped with a beautiful pyramidal spire and houses a
                large gilded statue of Buddha.</p>

            <p style="font-size:20px ;margin:80px ;justify-content: center;display: flex;flex-direction: column;">
                Construction of Hyderabad's Mecca Masjid, one of the world's largest mosques – and one of the oldest in
                India – began in 1614 during Mohammed Quli Qutub Shah's reign and took almost 80 years to complete. <br>

                Large enough to accommodate 10,000 worshipers, this beautiful mosque's 15 enormous arches and pillars
                were each wrought from single slabs of black granite dragged to the site by huge cattle trains reputedly
                consisting of up to 1,400 bulls. <br>

                Taking its name from the bricks above the central gate that were brought here from Mecca, this
                impressive complex features highlights such as its main gateway, a huge plaza, and a large manmade pond.
                There's also a room that houses the hair of Prophet Mohammed.</p>

                Dominating the old city of Jodhpur, the massive Mehrangarh Fort, one of the largest fortifications in
                India, was built in the 15th century to safeguard the people of the famous "Blue City." Jodhpur is still
                known by this name, which is derived from its indigo-colored houses, painted blue to deflect the heat.
                <br>

                Built on top of a towering outcrop, Mehrangarh is an amazing feat of construction, its massive walls all
                but impenetrable. Access is via one of seven splendid gates, including Jaya Pol and Fateh Pol (the
                latter still bears scars from cannon attacks). <br>

                Highlights of a visit include exploring the fort's fascinating network of courtyards and palaces, as
                well as a museum housing a splendid collection of artifacts related to the Maharajas. Be sure to spend
                time in the historic center of Jodhpur itself, famous for its eight city gates, a lovely old clock
                tower, and numerous bazaars selling everything from vegetables to sweets, spices, and handicrafts.

            <p style="font-size:20px ;margin:80px ;justify-content: center;display: flex;flex-direction: column;">The
                sprawling city of Mysore is a delight to explore thanks to its eclectic mix of fine old colonial
                architecture; regal Indian palaces; and lush, well-manicured gardens. While those inclined towards
                shopping will enjoy spending time in the city's famous silk and sandalwood bazaars, the main attraction
                is magnificent Mysore Palace. <br>

                Completely rebuilt in 1897 after a devastating fire, this beautiful three-storied palace features
                highlights such as its elegant square towers and domes; the many ornate ceilings and pillars in Durbar
                Hall; and the splendid Marriage Pavilion, with its glazed floor tiles, stunning stained glass, artworks,
                and displays of jewelry. It's also where, on special occasions, the exquisite Golden Throne is
                exhibited. <br>

                For a real treat, be sure to catch one of the splendid light displays held each Sunday and during
                holidays, when the palace is illuminated by more than 90,000 lights. A fun way to explore the palace's
                massive grounds and gardens is as part of a cycle tour, available free once inside.</p>

            <p style="font-size:20px ;margin:90px ;justify-content: center;display: flex;flex-direction: column;">One of
                South India's most popular tourist attractions, Periyar National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary is centered
                around a lake built by British engineers in 1895 for irrigation and to provide water to the city of
                Madurai. <br>

                Established in 1934, this beautiful park is home to numerous species of mammals, including a large
                free-roaming Indian elephant population, wild boar, otters, the lion-tailed macaque, and more than 20
                Bengal tigers. Bird-watching is a popular activity with frequent sightings of species such as darters,
                storks, kingfishers, hornbills, and racket-tailed drongos, along with many interesting varieties of
                butterflies. <br>

                The best ways to enjoy the park's splendid mountain scenery are to take a lake cruise or guided jungle
                walk, the latter allowing visitors a chance to come face to face with elephant herds and observe other
                wildlife from watchtowers and viewing platforms.</p>
